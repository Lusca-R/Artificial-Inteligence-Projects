Recall in lecture that we called these encoder-decoder models \"Conditional Language Models\" since they condition on some prefix before generating text similar to the language models we have seen before. Therefore, we can use **perplexity** to measure the performance of our model.\n","\n","However, perplexity is more of an intrinsic measure and so we'd like to directly measure how closely the model output is to our generated translations. How do we do this? We can look at how well our translation _overlaps_ with the reference translation. A common metric for this is the **BLEU** (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) metric. The approach works by counting matching n-grams in the candidate translation to n-grams in the reference text, where 1-gram or unigram would be each token and a bigram comparison would be each word pair. The comparison is made regardless of word order. BLEU uses N-grams of size 1-4 in its computation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oFYJdd9kYhXq"},"source":["## Part 1: Rules\n","**Part 1** requires implementing an RNN in PyTorch for translation.

You **cannot** use any such code (though you may use anything you find in course notes or course texts) irrespective of whether you cite it or not.\n","\n","Submissions will be passed through the MOSS system, which is a sophisticated system for detecting plagiarism in code and is robust in the sense that it tries to find alignments in the underlying semantics of the code and not just the surface level syntax.
